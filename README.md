# 42_pipex

Conceptually, a pipe is a connection between two processes, such that the standard output from one process becomes the standard input of the other process. In UNIX Operating System, Pipes are useful for communication between related processes(inter-process communication).

This project involves creating a C program that performs a pipe operation similar to how it is done in Bash.
It must behave exactly the same as the shell command below:

``` sh
$ < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
```
