1.	Double error massege: every error occured inside a child process gets its specific
	error masssege plus the general error massege after a waitpid with error sign.
	ex: ./pipex input.txt "sort -r" "cat" output.txt

2.	Simple quotation dont work: separate string not only by SPACE but by ' to.
	ex: ./pipex input2.txt "grep 'pattern'" "wc -w" output.txt

3. Make error_massage output like the shell.
