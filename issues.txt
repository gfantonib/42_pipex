1.	Double error massege: every error occured inside a child process gets its specific
	error masssege plus the general error massege after a waitpid with error sign.
	ex: ./pipex file1 "grep patternN" "wc -w" file2

2.	Simple quotation dont work: separate string not only by SPACE but by ' to.
	ex: ./pipex input2.txt "grep 'pattern'" "wc -w" output.txt

3. Make error_massage output like the shell.

$> cat -e <<EOF | grep line
Text to be passed to command1
line 2 of the input
EOF

$> ./pipex here_doc LIMITER cmd cmd1 file
